      <h2>Understanding Heart Disease</h2>
      <p>Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally. It encompasses a spectrum of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, ranging from coronary artery blockages and arrhythmias to congenital anomalies and valve dysfunctions.</p>
      <p>Despite its widespread impact, many individuals remain undiagnosed until symptoms become severe. PulsePrism addresses this gap by offering a data-driven preliminary assessment using non-invasive clinical indicators—empowering users with foresight before crisis strikes.</p>
      <p>Early detection isn't just about extending life—it’s about preserving quality of life, minimizing medical costs, and enabling timely lifestyle adjustments. PulsePrism bridges the gap between clinical complexity and public accessibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Inside the PulsePrism Engine</h2>
      <p>At its core, PulsePrism leverages a fine-tuned Logistic Regression model trained on the UCI Cleveland dataset. The data undergoes rigorous preprocessing: missing values are imputed, continuous features are normalized using robust scalers, and categorical variables are one-hot encoded to retain dimensional integrity.</p>
      <p>Model selection involved benchmarking Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting alongside Logistic Regression. The final model was chosen based on ROC-AUC performance, interpretability, and consistency under k-fold cross-validation. Hyperparameters were optimized through RandomizedSearchCV, resulting in a model that balances recall and precision with 87.1% accuracy and a 0.89 F1 score.</p>
      <p>The system is deployed as a Flask-based RESTful API, containerized using Docker for consistent environment replication and scalable deployment via cloud platforms. Render hosts the app with CI/CD pipelines triggered via GitHub Actions, ensuring reliability and fast iteration cycles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Who Should Use PulsePrism?</h2>
      <p>PulsePrism is designed for a wide spectrum of users: individuals tracking their heart health, clinicians seeking a second-opinion screening tool, and researchers exploring clinical ML applications. Its intuitive interface ensures usability for non-technical users, while the backend architecture satisfies technical reliability standards expected in healthcare-adjacent tools.</p>
      <p>Medical students can use PulsePrism to simulate real-world case evaluations. Hospitals and clinics can incorporate it into electronic medical records for triaging low-risk and high-risk patients. Health-tech enthusiasts can deploy it on custom dashboards, integrating wellness monitoring with wearable data.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, PulsePrism puts actionable insight in the hands of users who need it most—early, accessible, and interpretable.</p>
