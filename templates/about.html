    <h2>🎯 Why I Built PulsePrism</h2>
    <p>PulsePrism started with a simple goal: make early heart disease detection more accessible. Not everyone has immediate access to healthcare, but most people have access to the internet. So I asked myself — what if I could offer a meaningful prediction based on basic clinical data, right from your browser?</p>
    <p>I wanted a tool that didn’t scare people, but informed them. Something clean, data-driven, and trustworthy.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>📊 The Dataset That Powers It</h2>
    <p>PulsePrism is built on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset — a real, medically validated dataset used by researchers for decades. It includes 14 features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more. I cleaned the data, removed inconsistencies, and scaled it for model input so it performs well without biasing on any single metric.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>🧠 What the Model Does (and Why We Chose It)</h2>
    <p>I tried various algorithms — KNN, Random Forest, Decision Trees. But Logistic Regression stood out. Not only did it deliver high accuracy (87.1%), it was also interpretable. That mattered to me, because I didn’t want users to get “black box” results.</p>
    <p>Using techniques like RandomizedSearchCV, I tweaked the parameters and got strong performance on recall and AUC. That means it doesn’t just predict well — it actually helps detect real risks.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>🚀 Tech Stack</h2>
    <p>Everything runs inside a Flask app, wrapped in Docker for deployment. The ML model is exposed via REST API. I host it on Render, and every Git commit can trigger a redeploy automatically.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python & Flask</strong> – For model backend</li>
      <li><strong>Scikit-learn</strong> – Core ML toolkit</li>
      <li><strong>Docker</strong> – Portability & consistency</li>
      <li><strong>Render</strong> – Hosting the live version</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>👥 Who It’s For</h2>
    <p>I built this for students, developers, clinicians, and even curious individuals. You don’t need to be a data scientist or a doctor — if you can read your health reports, you can use PulsePrism.</p>
    <p>Just remember, it’s a guide, not a diagnosis. Always follow up with a real doctor. But if PulsePrism makes you ask one more important question about your heart, I’ve done my job.</p>

  <h2>👨‍💻 About the Creator</h2>
  <p>
    PulsePrism was created by Nikhil Palande a postgraduate in Computer Applications with a strong interest in AI, machine learning, and software development. The goal was to build something that not only works technically but also helps people make informed health decisions using accessible technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project brings together skills in data science, backend development (Flask, REST APIs), and frontend design — all packaged into a responsive, user-friendly app deployed in a real-world environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you're a fellow developer, a healthcare student, or just curious about how AI can assist with heart health, I hope PulsePrism gives you something useful — and maybe even sparks new ideas of your own.
  </p>
